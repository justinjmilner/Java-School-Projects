# Java-School-Projects

Welcome to my repository of Java school projects! This collection includes a variety of Java projects that were created as part of my learning journey in object-oriented programming.

## About

These projects were developed to explore and apply the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java. Each project showcases different aspects of Java development, from class design to problem-solving and algorithm implementation.

## Authorship

All the code in this repository was authored by me, with a focus on hands-on learning and understanding Java programming concepts. While I worked independently on these projects, I may have referenced and imported external files or libraries to enhance my learning experience.

Feel free to explore the projects, review the code, and use them as educational resources for your own Java programming journey. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out!

Happy coding!
